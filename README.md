# 

Using [this counter app](https://codesandbox.io/s/2lkk7484y) as a starting point, add three buttons: 

- `increment if even`
- `increment if odd`
- `increment async` which will increment after one second has passed. 


These will only require additions to the `CounterContainer` and `Counter` components.
